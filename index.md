I’m a Ph.D. student of [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland](https://www.umd.edu/). Prior to Maryland, I studied economics and mathematics at [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). My research interests fall in political economy and labor economics, with focus on issues about China.
